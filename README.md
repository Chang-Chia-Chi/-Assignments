# Machine Learning Foundations & Techniques

Machine learning is the study that allows computers to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the data observed. Our two sister courses teach the most fundamental algorithmic, theoretical and practical tools that any user of machine learning needs to know.

## Machine learning foundations
Machine learning is the study that allows computers to adaptively improve their performance with experience accumulated from the data observed. Our two sister courses teach the most fundamental algorithmic, theoretical and practical tools that any user of machine learning needs to know. 

The first course of the two would focus more on `mathematical` tools.   
The second course of the two would focus more on `algorithmic` tools.
